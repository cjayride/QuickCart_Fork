## Allows quick attach / detach carts via a hotkey, even when not in position.

This mod adds a customizable hotkey (default V) that allows you to attach or detach a nearby cart (nearest if there are several) without having to point the cross hairs at the attach area.

## Configuration

A config file **BepInEx/config/cjayride.QuickCart.cfg** is created after running the game once with this mod.
